# CS220AU Digital Portfolio Template (2022)
## Overview
This GitHub repository is the template for the [CS220AU](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU) assignment in 2022. It demonstrates minimalistic ideas for 

- project management
- web hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
- web-design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
- evaluation with the `assessment.md` and the `dp-checklist.md` files. 

The URL of the website can be found in the sidebar, under 'About'. The homepage uses the information in the `index.md` file.

## Portfolio items
My portfolio contains the follow:

1. **website** exploring the theme of digital identities and the existential risks that can linked to them, including my past and future digital identites and the use of visitor and resident (V&R) mapping.
2. **self-and peer-assessment** using the marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file.
3. **portfolio overview** providing a succinct overview of my portfolio, an outline of completed tasks (Log) and tasks to do (TODO) in this `README.md` file. 

## Peer-assesment 
Due to difficulties with illness and absence, I have unfortunately been unable to complete any kind of peer-assesment with classmates, however I have provided a self-assesment to make up for this.
