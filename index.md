# Digital Identities and the existential risks that exist 

In this writing I will explore the types of digital identities that exist in the world as well as investigate the existential risks that are posed by our identities online. Furthermore, I will give an introduction to what digital identites are and  discuss what I have found out about our safety online. 


## What are digital identities? 

In order acknowledge our own digital identities, we must first understand what are. Digital identities are an individual's online persona. They serve to represent an individual's online presence and may be used to verify an individual's identification when logging into online accounts or doing online transactions. Digital identities can include details like a person's name, date of birth, and contact information and are frequently connected to certain devices, such a computer or smartphone. To provide further security and fraud protection, a digital identity may occasionally be validated by a third party, such as a government agency or financial institution. Moreover, below I will be listing some of the main forms of digital identity which are seen most frequently. 

## Types of digital identity 

* Social Media Accounts: Users can register for an account on several social media platforms and use it to identify themselves online. These accounts typically have a username or handle in addition to other private data that can be used to confirm the user's identity. 

* Biometric Data: Biometric information describes a person's distinctive physical traits, such as their fingerprints or iris patterns. These can be used to establish a digital identity that is challenging to mimic or forge. 

* Single sign-on (SSO) accounts: Users that have SSO accounts can sign in to numerous services or websites with just one set of credentials. Users may find it easier to maintain their digital identities as a result because they only need to remember one set of login details. 

* Cryptographic keys: Cryptographic keys are mathematical values that are used to encrypt and decrypt data. They can also be used to create digital signatures, which can be used to verify the identity of the person or entity using the key 

* Government-issued IDs: In some cases, government-issued IDs such as driver's licenses or passport numbers can be used as digital identities. These can be used to verify the user's identity for various purposes, such as voting or accessing government services online.


## How digital identities can cause existential risks 

Existential risks are risks that have the ability to substantially or completely destroy humanity to a point where it is irreparable. During my research I have come to the realization that there is not necessarily a direct link between digital identities and such risks, but rather a potential link between how digital identities are used and how they can lead to a threat against humanity. Within this section, I will identify the links between the risks I have identified and discuss how the existence of digital identities can be threatened by them. 

#### Artificial Intelligence 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in devices created to act and think like people. Although AI has a lot of potential benefits, it could also pose an existential threat to digital identity in some situations. For instance, a competent AI system with access to a person's wealth of personal data may be able to create digital identities that are almost identical to the real person, making it difficult for others to spot fraud and put a stop to it. Additionally, the application of AI to marketing could produce more individualized and focused advertisements, raising concerns about privacy and the improper use of user data. 

#### Centralization of Digital Identities 

In many ways, the centralization of digital identities, in which all or most are under the control of a single individual or group, could pose an existential threat. First, if the central authority in charge of managing digital identities were to become corrupted or evil, it might have access to a great amount of personal data about people. It might be used for criminal activities like identity theft or other types of fraud. Furthermore, all of the digital identities that the central authority manages could perhaps be lost or rendered inaccessible if it were to experience a catastrophic collapse or come under cyberattack. For people and organizations that depend on such digital identities, this might have serious repercussions. 


# Visitor and Resident Mapping

In my research in exploring digital identities, I have used the concept of David White's Et al's Visitor and Resident (V&R) mapping to understand digital engagement in a wider context, as well as in relation to my own. The V&R map breaks our engagagement online into two modes, Visitor and Resident. Visitor mode is where 'individuals decide on the task they wish to undertake' (White 2014) such as Youtube or Google. Resident mode is a mode that is 'about social presence, where 'the individual is going online to connect to, or to be with, other people.' (White 2014). Furthermore, the V&R map breaks digital identites into two more aspects, whether they are institutional or personal. Institutional includes academic websites, such as moodle or a company website, whereas personal includes websites that are interesting to a someone on a personal level, such as blogs or looking at pages for enjoyment. The difference between these two levels is important in recognising the alternate aspects of digital identity, as there is a clear speration of someones's personal and proffesional activity. 

Looking at the different modes that digital identity has been broken down into, I have begun to understand the importance of how my role as a visitor or a resident have constructed my own digital identity. For example, a social media post that I shared a few years ago could pose a threat to how my identity is portrayed online, whether it is a simple mistake or a controversial opinion, every thing which people share online can be seen as being harmful or incorrect, thus causing the effect of hindering our presence online. With these thoughts, I believe it is extremely important to consider both past and present digital identites, as they will continue to exist in a world where technology is ever present. 

## My Past Digital Identity 

With the use of the Visitor and Resident (V&R) mapping, It has enabled me to view my personal engagement with the online world. The majority of my visitor activity includes research for essays on search engines such as Google, watching YouTube videos for entertainment, and WhatsApp for contacting colleagues and fellow students. However, my resident activity primary includes Snapchat, Instagram and Spotify.

The V&R map has been an effective way of seeing my engagement with the web and has helped me to understand how my digital identity looks, and how I could make changes to obtain a greater and more positive digital identity. 

My past digital identity can be broken down using my own personal V&R map, which I have constructed according to the criteria. (See Below)

## My Future Digital Identity 

From looking at my own personal V&R map, I have reflected on what I could do to enhance my digital identity. My excessive use of social media and sources of entertainment is a clear weakness to me, as it is unproductive and time-consuming. With this analysis of my past and/or current digital identity, I have developed a V&R map which I plan to look more like this. (See Below)
