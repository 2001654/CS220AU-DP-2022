# Digital Identities and the existential risks that exist 

In this website I will explore the types of digital identities that exist in the world as well as investigate the existential risks that are posed by our identities online. Furthermore, I will give an introduction to what digital identites are and  discuss what I have found out about our safety online.

## What are digital identities? 

Digital identities are an individual's online personas. They serve to represent an individual's online presence and may be used to verify an individual's identification when logging into online accounts or doing online transactions. Digital identities can include details like a person's name, date of birth, and contact information and are frequently connected to certain devices, such a computer or smartphone. To provide further security and fraud protection, a digital identity may occasionally be validated by a third party, such as a government agency or financial institution. Moreover, below I will be listing some of the main forms of digital identity which are seen most frequently. 

## Types of digital identity 

* Social Media Accounts - Users can register for an account on several social media platforms and use it to identify themselves online. These accounts typically have a username or handle in addition to other private data that can be used to confirm the user's identity. 

* Biometric Data - Biometric information describes a person's distinctive physical traits, such as their fingerprints or iris patterns. These can be used to establish a digital identity that is challenging to mimic or forge. 

* Single sign-on (SSO) accounts - Users that have SSO accounts can sign in to numerous services or websites with just one set of credentials. Users may find it easier to maintain their digital identities as a result because they only need to remember one set of login details.


## How digital identities can cause existential risks 

Existential risks are risks that have the ability to substantially or completely destroy humanity to a point where it is irreparable. During my research I have come to the conclusion that there is not necessarily a direct link between digital identities and such risks, but rather a potential link between how digital identities are used and a threat against humanity. Within this section, I will identify the links between the risks I have identified and discuss how the existence of digital identities can be threatened by them.
